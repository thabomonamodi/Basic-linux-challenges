TASK 1: BASIC TASK

1. I see folders: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Templates and Videos. This means that ls lists all the folders/prints content of directories.

2. I see 2 directories: /home/recruit. This means that pwd shows the current working directory.

3. recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ mkdir workspace 
   recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ cd workspace

4. Nothing, this means that the newly created folder/directory is empty.

5. recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ touch README.md

6. recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ cp README.md CHANGELOG.md
